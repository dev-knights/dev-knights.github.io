A year ago I read an [article](https://sg.com.mx/revista/53/el-caso-php-y-los-salarios#.WKdlaxIrKRv) published in the software magazine Software Gurú by [Basilio Briseño](https://sg.com.mx/sgvirtual/speakers/basilio-brice-o) where He stated that PHP is one of the least paid languages ​​in Mexico and why that happened. In his article He also published a tabulator of the type of programmer made by the group of programmers "PHP Mexico".

Although the tabulator is geared towards the skills of a PHP programmer, the concept of the type of programmer that is listed in each section suggests what a Rookie, Junior, Senior or Master developer is expected to be in order to fall classification.

The tabulator could be generalized as follows:

- **Rookie** usually writes code without consistency in indentation or conventions and usually copies and pastes anything found on the internet that seems to do what it was asked to deliver and that, according to the forums, is the solution.

- **Apprentice** has accepted that he needs to improve and decides to learn best practices and apply them. Consult in forums not to look for code to copy and paste, but to analyze it and ask after having investigated by his own.

- **Junior** knows what the design patterns are and use them, understand what MVC, REST, CRUD, ORM, SQL Injection, XSS, I / O Sanitization, etc. are, and use these and other techniques, as well as best practices; It is excellent learning and using third-party APIs.

- **Senior** is capable of developing his own tools and APIs; is aware of how his domain language works internally, is highly interested in the performance of applications beyond its ease of development; he is not satisfied with the functioning of all third-party tools and APIs as they come, and always seeks to innovate and create things that improve performance, facilitate their work and the speed of their deliverables; contributes with code in different projects and communities.

- **Master** is capable of developing his own extensions, gems or libraries, or optimizing them for his best use; contributes to Open Source projects and he is normally dedicated to improving the performance of high performance applications. Knows the domain language, its origin and differences with others.

- **Core** contributes to the development of the core of the domain language; contributes in some extensions, gems or libraries and public tools; He is a frequent speaker at international conferences and it is usual to see his name in the credits in changes of version of his domain language.

So ... What kind of programmer are you?

> Many developers are named Senior after years of work, or experts in some framework or language when they only do tutorials; however, your work and contribution and how it affects in other places (not only where you work) speaks better of the type of programmer you are.
